<li>Our first geocaching experience downtown Burlington, VT. I'm on the right. I believe this was BEFORE I nearly ripped a utility box off a sign pole. I was convinced the cache was in the box. We found the cache months later. It was not in the box on the sign pole.</p>
<p>It was in the bushes.</p>
