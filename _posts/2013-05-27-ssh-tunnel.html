<p>There are times I wish I could get a second opinion about DNS resolution at work, and 
times when I simply want to check in on my home network (are the kids playing Minecraft instead of 
finishing homework?). Nothing makes 
this easier than an SSH tunnel. An SSH tunnel is a secure path to a remote network. In fact, if you set up 
a proxy in your favorite web browser to your DD-WRT router at home, you can access your home web server.</p>
<p>I have an alias set up on my machine that looks something like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
alias phonehome='killall ssh;ssh -p [remote port] -D [local port] -f -C -N  [server user]@[server address]'
</pre>
<p>At any moment I can drop to a command line and type 'phonehome,' and this little command will kill all previous
instances of SSH that were running (you may not want that, but being forgetful I used to accidentally leave on multiple
tunnels), and SSH into the server with a persistent connection.  After you enter your password, you will be returned
to your command prompt. What? Yeah- it's working. Use ps ax to prove it:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
$ ps ax | grep ssh
 5939   ??  S      0:03.19 /usr/bin/ssh-agent -l
13565   ??  Ss     0:00.00 ssh -p 22 -D 7880 -f -C -N adam@myserver.org
13567 s000  R+     0:00.00 grep ssh
</pre>
<p>As you can see, process 13565 lists the connection to my server. You might want to consider using SSH keys for this, too
so you are not required to type your password every time. Once the tunnel is in place, 
using it with your browser is a matter of setting up your proxy. In Firefox under Preferences/Advanced/Network it looks like this:</p>

<p>Your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS">SOCKS v5</a> proxy host will be your local computer, so in most cases 127.0.0.1
should suffice. The local port in our example is 7880. I also highly recommend changing your remote server's port from the default 22.</p>
