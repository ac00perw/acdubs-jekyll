 the moment when I decided to try something other than a Gillette product
to shave my beard. At the time, I was not aware that there were any other options, to be honest. My only
exposure to shaving products was my local grocery where there were and still solely cartridge razors for sale,
save that maybe one set of blades. Needless to say, after a shaving related internet search I was more than intrigued.</p>
<p>I've always had great disdain for Gillette, though. I forget which incarnation of their ridiculous line
of multi-bladed razors I had at the time, but I definitely remember wondering how a company could manufacture a blade
that gets dull so quickly. And on the 2nd or 3rd shave with the same cartridge I recall tearing up as 
the razor snagged on every pass of my upper lip. It was a horrible and painful experience which lead
to less shaving which lead to an even more horrible experience with a longer beard and a duller blade. </p>   
<p>In my upcoming posts, I'll outline some techniques, point you to some great resources, give you some
tips of my own, and hopefully get you excited enough to try shaving with a safety razor. For now, I'll leave you
with a short list of pros and cons I've come up with to help me outline my thoughts on the subject. I'm also working 
on a detailed cost comparison partly for own sanity. While shaving with a double edge is ultimately cheap, it's quite
easy to wrapped up in the ritual of it, and thus buy a twenty dollar tub of high-end shaving cream instead of opting for
a 2 dollar soap.</p>
