<p>I recently had an interview for a job at a local web outfit here in Burlington, VT. Knowing they'd been around for a while, I donned my business casual uniform of khakis and a button-down and headed over. The other interviews I had were shorts and tshirts casual. The young guys know the drill- dress up for clients and dress comfortably for work.</p>
<p>Over the course of the interview, the guy I would assume was the CTO asked questions I didn't have answers for like what was my favorite feature of the upcoming release of ECMA Script.</p>
<p>I left feeling dejected. I didn't have an answer for most of his questions relating to technology I hadn't used yet. It occurred to me a few days later that his line of questions was not geared towards somebody working with technology but rather for somebody administering technology. In a Home Depot scenario, he was hiring a clerk for the power tools section, and I'm building a cabinet. The clerk should have a great general knowledge of all of the tools in his section, and probably to some extent the tools soon to be released. I just need the tools to build a solid cabinet with efficiency.</p>
<p>As an older fellow in a young people's career, I often doubt myself probably more than the average Joe/Joan. Is it better to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">Impostor Syndrome</a> as opposed to being a case study for the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger Effect</a>?</p>
<p>And my closing thought: Everybody uses Google, and I'd love for this to be a bit tighter of a wrap-up but the guy across the street's been trimming his hedge for three fucking hours and the noise is driving me batty.</p>
