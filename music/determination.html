maybe it never got started<br />
or it feeds to you the lieses<br />
or the yeast didn't kick in<br />
so the bread never rises<br />
or in growth it measures inches<br />
but it never changes sizes<br />
so it gets up to the doorses<br />
but the bells it never ringses<br />
cuz from the mat it fails to reach buzzer<br />
<br />
it means so well it means oh well oh<br />
it means so well it means oh well oh it means oh well oh<br />
<br />
maybe it best to be departed<br />
as it thinks of it the hardest<br />
as in no one else would matter<br />
as in can drown this background clatter<br />
whilst eyes from high the ones who blow it<br />
as if there is no you in universe<br />
