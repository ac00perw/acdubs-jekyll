<p><img align="left" src="/images/jagger.jpg" width="25%"/>Info about safety razors, shaving Gillette-free, understanding that multiple blades does not mean better shave 
(the first blades are not lifting your beard up while the the rest of them shave you!), and some price
comparisons to shaving with cartridges vs. safety razors with links to prices on Amazon 
and <a href="http://leesrazors.com">Lee's Razors</a> (Edwin Jagger handle pictured- I bought mine at Lee's) are coming.</p>
