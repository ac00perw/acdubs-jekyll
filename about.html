		<p>Need a liftable bio here</p>
		<p>Adam is a happy chap who lives in a quiet neighborhood on the other side of town. He rarely does any crimes.
		He makes web stuffs for a living. He has made a bunch of music <a href="https://digthree.bandcamp.com/">here</a>, <a href="http://phy.sics.club">here</a>, and <a href="http://soundcloud.com/ac00perw">here</a>.</p>
		<p>This site was originally built on Drupal and then migrated to Jekyll for ease of use, low overhead, quick edits and dirty theming.
		Adam is learning a bit of Ruby through this experience and happy to be using his brain again. Drupal definitely served it's purpose though. 
		Being able to make posts on the train from Providence to Boston is pretty cool. But that's what Twitter is for (I'm at Target buying underwear).
		Jekyll has helped me come to the conclusion that I spend a fair amount of my time in front of a computer so it makes sense to be able to work on my site
		from in front of my computer. Instead of squinting at a phone.</p>
		
		<p>I have a running list <a href="/avclub/tech-specs/">my toys</a>.</p>
