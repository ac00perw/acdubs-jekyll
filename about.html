<h1>About Adam Cooper Wood</h1>
<p>Need a liftable bio here</p>
<div id="home">
<p>
Adam is a happy chap who lives in a quiet neighborhood on the other side of town. He rarely does any crimes. Rarely. 
He makes web stuffs for a living and likes it pretty good, too. He made this. It will grow in size, and as it grows in size it will
probably grow in shape, too. Someday- a bio.
</p>
<p>This site was originally built on Drupal and then migrated to Jekyll for ease of use, low overhead, quick edits and dirty theming.
Adam is learning a bit of Ruby through this experience and happy to be using his brain again. Drupal definitely served it's purpose though. 
Being able to make posts on the train from Providence to Boston is pretty cool. But that's what Twitter is for (I'm at Target buying underwear).
Jekyll has helped me come to the conclusion that I spend a fair amount of my time in front of a computer so it makes sense to be able to work on my site
from in front of my computer. Instead of squinting at a phone.<p>
<p>The whole Drupal to Jekyll conversion took about 4 hours and I must say it's not quite finished. Don't look at the CSS. It's ugly. I'll slim that down
and probably compress it eventually so I can maximize server usage and gain speed at the browser, too. I also have a beautiful little rakefile 
which deploys the site to my server with a single 3-word command. I've heard that Ruby ain't that fast, but when all the processing is happening before 
file even get rsynced to the server, it really doesn't matter. And I can't say enough about the lack of moving parts!</p>
<p>Having a Drupal install would take this thing down in a heartbeat.</p>
