Recreate the recipe for the best kale in the world. Or at least come up with a delicious and creative kale cooking concept centered around peanuts, spicy, maybe ginger, and a little bit of 'good for you' too. </p><p>I'm convinced the best kale in the world is <a href="http://mcafedechaya.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. It's a cold kale salad with a delicious somewhat spicy peanut sauce.&nbsp; East coast kale cooks take note- it would be worth driving to Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles to experience this salad. Make sure you call first. There's nothing worse than going there when they don't have kale.</p><p>PS- the term 'blanching' totally sucks. Probably because the first four letters are common in the word BLAND, too. Why don't they call it 'completely awesoming.'</p><p>Ok, I just tried it. Here's the recipe I used kinda- </p><p>1 bunch kale<br>3/4 cup water<br>2 heaping spoonfuls of peanut butter<br>2 teaspoons of chili sauce<br>2 dashes of ground ginger (would've preferred fresh, but didn't have any)<br>dash of salt<br><br>Blanch the kale in 2 qts hot water for 2.5 minutes (thanks Tanya for the time tip). While the kale is blanching, combine other ingredients in a bowl to create sauce. Drain kale and rinse with cold water. Put kale back in bowl and mix in sauce. 5 minutes and pure deliciousness </p><p>I've also had this without cooking the kale at all! Yes! Raw! My sister-in-law showed me the trick to making raw kale edible- cut it into extremely thin strips. I've cut the stalks out (spines?) too. I've also been playing around with alternate peanut sauces like <a href="/recipes/delicious-peanut-sauce">this one</a>.</p></div>
