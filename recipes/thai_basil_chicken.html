 - "<p>I have never had as much success with a recipe I've found online as I have with this one. I don't want to copy the recipe verbatim so head over to the link below to make it happen. Here are my changes: I added 2 tablespoons of water towards the end of the process (right after adding the basil) to keep the chicken juicy. I also only used 6 Thai chilies and I minced them so they their spice would be more evenly distributed. Lastly, I suggest using Thai basil if possible. Thai basil can usually be found in Thai/Asian markets and is a bit tangier than your garden variety.</p>"
