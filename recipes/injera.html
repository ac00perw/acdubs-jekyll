<p>Still searching for the perfect version. I've been creating a starter like you would for sourdough bread. You mix water, teff flour, and a little wheat flour and let it sit on the counter to gather yeast. Once the yeast has gathered, put it in the fridge and "feed" it occasionally. Please <a href="/contact">contact me</a> if I'm doing it wrong!</p>
