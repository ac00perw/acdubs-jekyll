<p>The main reason I wanted to build this project was to have an excuse to buy an Arduino. 
The appeal of having a 20x4 display into which I could filter the information I receive from 
the Internet was an appealing afterthought. Instead of my regular bombardment I could get
choosy. Here are the parts required for the build:</p>
<div class="large-4"><ul>
	<li>Arduino</li>
	<li>Ethernet Shield</li> 
	<li>20x4 LCD</li> 
	<li>toggle switch (Radio Shack)</li> 
	<li>LED</li>
</ul> </div>
